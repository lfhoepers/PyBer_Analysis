## Overview of the PyBer_Analysis

This project's main objective is to analyze and deliver data on the rides are running, reviewing fares, averages, the performance of type of cities, etc.
In addition to this main analysis, we will provide a line chart to with the 1st quarter of 2019 to have a better visualization of the data..

The following files were used for this analysis, which can be downloaded here:

[City_Data.csv](https://github.com/lfhoepers/PyBer_Analysis/blob/93aceb42750c195453099eb0ce39fc3ad2d4cb28/Resources/city_data.csv) 

[Ride_Data.csv](https://github.com/lfhoepers/PyBer_Analysis/blob/93aceb42750c195453099eb0ce39fc3ad2d4cb28/Resources/ride_data.csv)

This project was fully developed in Python using Pandas, Numpy and Motplotlib, code can be checked at the following link:

## Results:

As analyzed in both the dataframe and the graph, the first conclusion we have is that although rural rides have an average value per trip and per driver much higher than suburban and urban, the total value is much lower.
In other words, the profit that Pyber has in rural areas is much lower than in urban and suburban areas. But Driver can make more money in rural working less.

We can see in the Dataframe below, the comparisons of averages per trip and per driver, and compare with the total billed by Pyber:

The chart below has a position from 01/01/2019 to 04/28/2019, comparing the 3 city types by timeline. In general we can notice that the rides continue together, each one with its values, but without major temporal variations between them. Example just before March when all 3 types had a peak in Fares and then dropped, this demonstrates that there is no seasonality between them. What we really noticed is that the urban area always earns more  for Pyber than the other two.

## Summary: 

After a more in-depth analysis, I would like to leave here 3 suggestions for the company, who knows in this way we can increase profits:

- Create an analysis per hour of day. We can have a variation of trips between Urban and Suburban, to which we can invest more time at certain hours of day in each one.
 
- Investment in Marketing in Suburban can help a lot, I really believe that there is space for growth in rides, we just have to analyze how to reach this audience.

- In rural areas, we would have to try to increase the number of drivers, the impression I have at the moment is that we have few drivers there. Obviously we have to see if there is demand for this.

I appreciate the opportunity to present this project, I am available for any clarification.
